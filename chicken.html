        <h1>Chicken and Cats</h1>
        <p><b>Chicken</b> is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of
            raising them in
            comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout
            the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

        <p><b>Cat </b> is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body,
            quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and
            sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling,
            hissing,
            growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.
